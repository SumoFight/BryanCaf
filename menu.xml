<!--Purpose-->

Purpose
The purpose of this XML file is to store and structure the menu items for Bryan’s Café. It defines available food and drink options, including their names, prices, descriptions, and other relevant details. This file can be used to generate dynamic content on a website or to be processed by other systems (e.g., mobile apps, digital menus).

Expected Structure
	•	The root element is <menu>, which contains all items offered by the café.
	•	Two main types of items are included:
	•	<food>: Represents a food item.
	•	<drink>: Represents a drink item.
	•	Each <food> or <drink> element includes:
	•	<name> – the name of the item.
	•	<price> – the cost of the item.
	•	Optional elements for food items:
	•	<description> – a text description of the item.
	•	<calories> – the calorie count (only present for some food items).

Required Functionality
	•	The XML must be well-formed to be usable in web and software systems.
	•	It must allow the definition of both food and drink items under the same <menu> root.
	•	The file should support expansion with additional elements or attributes in the future.
	•	It should support integration into web pages or systems that display menu items or process orders.
