<!--Purpose-->

Purpose
The purpose of this XML file is to store and structure branch information for Bryan’s Café. It contains the location, phone number, and opening hours of each café branch. This data can be used to populate a website, feed into other applications, or validate structure using a DTD.

Expected Structure
	•	The root element is <branches>, which contains all branch records.
	•	Each <branch> element represents one physical location.
	•	Each <branch> includes three child elements:
	•	<location> – the address of the branch
	•	<phone> – the contact phone number
	•	<schedule> – the business hours

Required Functionality
	•	The XML must be well-formed to be readable by parsers and other tools.
	•	It must support multiple <branch> entries under the <branches> root.
	•	The structure should be consistent and optionally validated against a DTD.
	•	The XML file should support integration into a website or back-end system where branch data is displayed or processed.
